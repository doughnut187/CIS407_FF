My Fitness Fiend is a comprehensive workout companion app that will assist with motivation by gamifying the process of achieving fitness, while also consolidating physical education into one manageable database into one web application. The app delivers a personalized workout plan based on the “Fitness Goal” selected by the user. Users can choose to receive a more tailored plan by entering their biometric data (weight, height, personal records) and can choose their method of delivery (email or in-app) and frequency.
The user’s Fitness Fiend will be awarded experience for each workout the user logs in the app, with bonus experience awarded based on the user’s Fitness Goal, and other behavior or activities that contribute to maintaining a consistent, fitness habit. With enough experience, the Fitness Fiend will level up and eventually change forms. There are multiple Fitness Fiends, each with several forms, for the user to discover on their fitness journey.
